for loops
for arg in [list]
do
  command(s)...
done

while [ condition ]
do
  command(s)...
done

example:
while read line
do 
 echo $line
done

opposite of a while loop is until loop
until [ condition-is-true ]
do
 command(s)...
done

case (in) / esac

case "$variable" in
  "$condition1" ) echo "1";;
  "$condition2" ) echo "2";;
  * ) echo "default";;
esac
